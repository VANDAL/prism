     * combining a raw CPU log with side-channel data (task
     * switchting, interrupts, et al) to produce a coherent
     * instruction trace. This trace is not sent in real-time,

     * threads.

     * XXX MDL20170414
     * Right now only one perf event stream can be
     * sent to Prism at a time. No guarantees are given as to the
     * interleaving of events. It may well be that an entire thread's
     * instruction stream arrives AFTER a parallel thread, even
     * though those two threads were running at the same time.
     * This is inherent to how perf records and decodes intel_pt data.
     * Custom modifications to the way we read in and process the
     * intel_pt data would be required to send multiple event streams
     * in parallel from perf to Prism. */
